        <a href="mailto:mindlikewater@gmail.com">Tai Chen</a> and
        <a href="mailto:dmagwood13@gmail.com">DaQunda Magwood</a>, two fledgling
        Software Engineers, teamed up to bring you Snapogram!  Their website
        puts a retro spin on photo-sharing by displaying photos as polaroid pictures.
        By clicking on the "Add a Pic" link, anyone can contribute their favorite
        photos to the image gallery.
